# ResearchProject2

The aim of the project was to use machine learning techniques to analyze the predictors of movie success in terms of IMDB score and identify which variables have the most impact on the score.Based on the analysis conducted in thw research paper, film production studios can infer that duration and director popularity can affect positively the success of movies. However, this paper can only serve as a basis and some more investigation needs to be done in order to have more robust insights on what factors influence the ratings of movies and how movie production companies can leverage those factors to make successful films.
